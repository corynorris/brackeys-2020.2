## Demo

## Instructions
On your way back to Earth from mining operations somewhere in the Betelgeuse galaxy, your freighter is struck by an unknown interstellar object leading to a thermonuclear reaction. You barely escape in a small vessel but the shockwave knocks out your engines and you crash land on a nearby, barely habitable desert world.

Your craft can barely hold itself together, thankfully the hull is structurally sound but the sandstorm and falling debris are chipping away the integrity. 

AWSD - to move

E - interact

SPACE - attack/harvest

Collect scrap to upgrade, repair and craft

Collect food to survive (needs to be processed on the ship)
